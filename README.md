Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is a segment in computer science that focuses on design, development,testingand maintenance of software applications. Engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutons for end user are done by Software Engineers. 

 
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Enginering is a systematic way of approaching the development,operation and maintenance of software. Software Engineering differs from traditional programming by oncoporating a wider set of principles,methodologies and practices to enable the development of high quality, reliable and maintainable software systems.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Software Development Life Cycle is a process used to create high quality software that is cost effective and time efficient. The SDLC has 7 phases which are :
a) Planning and Analysis- This is the 1st stage where neccessary requirements like cost of production,end users needs e.t.c. are gathered. A decision is made on what to use or not to use on the project.
b) Requirements Definition- Information gathered is converted to clear requirements for the development of several document policies.
c) Design- The origunal plan is converted into a software design document (SDD) 
 that includes the system design,application and security systems. A prototype is designed in this stage for sampling.
 d) Development- Devolpment starts here of the project and teams are assigned into different departments that will convert the requirements into a code that will make the product. 
 e) Testing -  Before the product is realised to the end users, tests need to be run by the quality assurance team to check out any errors or bugs that can be corrected swiftly. There are different type of tests that are done to ensure the quality of the product.

 f) Deployment- The product is delivered to the relevant users that can be a smallgroup to see how they react to the new product.
 g) Maintenance- This is the last stage of the SDLC where bugs and errors found by users can be eliminated to make the product great quality. These bugs must be fixed for better user experience.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
The Agile model is a repetitive model for building software and applications which is easy for big and small projrcts. The Waterfall model is a sequential model that involves phases for each item on the project development. 
The difference between these models is : 
1. In the Agile model a client's input is required throughout the project development but the Waterfall model requires the client's input phase by phase.
2. An Agile model allows changes at any stage whilst the Waterfall model only allows changes after a phase is completed.
3. Project teams must coordinate to ensure correctness ofthe development of a project on the Agile model but the Waterfall model does not required coordination simce teams start when another one finishes.
4. Testing can only be done upon completion of the project on the waterfall model but the Agile model can do tests even before the development of the projrc.
5. A waterfall model requires a large team whilst the agile model requires a small team for production.
- The Waterfall model is mostly used by banks, governments, amd insurances whilst the Aile model is mostly used by small companies or start up companies. 

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is "the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements.It involves activities such as elicitation, analysis,specification and verification to ensure software meets stakeholder's needs" (Software mind blog. 2023)
Requirements engineering is a technique for regulating processes in the SDLC. Engineering and requirements management are the major processes to maintain control over a project and ensure collaboration throughout the board. This also enables teams to identify,analyze and manage changes so that a project stays afloat with the client's expectations.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modurality is the practice of breaking down a system into tiny, manageable and independent modules whereby each module has a well defined function and interface that can be developed,tested and maintained independently
- Modurality improves maintainability by seperating changes when a module needs an update or to be fixed. This is a good impact on the functionality of the system because the system can still function without disturbances when a module is being fixed.
- Modurality facilitates scalability by permitting easier integration of new features. New modules can be added without affecting existing ones and this extends the functionality of the system.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
- Unit testing: Tests on individual units or components of the software.
- Integration testing: Testing of components of a software as a unified group.
- System testing:A test done on various components of an application how they integrate together in a system.
- Acceptance testing: Final testing stage to test if the software product delivers on its promises. 
Testing is crucial in software development so as to curb glitches in any major user experience issues and security issues. 


Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
- Version control systems are a branch of software tools that assists in recording changes made to files by keeping track of modifications done in the code. 
- Version control systems are important because it assists the developer team to effectively track and communicate all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who and what changes have been made.A seperate branch is established to include who made the changes.

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
- A Software project manager oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects. 
* Responsibilities*
- Project planning - The manager defines project goals, scope and objectives creating a detailed project plan.
- Team management- The project manager combines and leads cross functional teams, assigns roles and responsibilities, facilitate efective communucation and ensures proper resources and support.
- Stakeholder management- They engage with stakeholders to understand their requirements and expectations.
- Risk management- Identifies potential risks and develops strategies to mitigate them.
- Budget and resource allocation-  Manages project budgets, tracks expenses and makes efficient resource allocation.
- Progress monitoring and reporting- Tracks project progress and deadlines.
- Continuous improvement- Instigates retrospective meetings and gathers feedback to identify areas of improvement.
* Challenges* 
-Communication- poor communication between team members can cause strife between team members and leads to delays in the project.
- Lack of accountability- Team members have a vital role to play in the success of a project and the manager has to make sure that team members are held accountable to the organization's standards.
- Resource allocation- Project managers are asked to make use of available resources even if they are insufficient.

Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
- Software maintenance is a perpetual process that happens throughout the entire life cycle of the software system. 
* Types of Software Maintenance*
- Patching- It is an emergency fix done mainly due to pressure from management. 
- Corrective maintenance-  It involves fixing errors and bugs in the software. 
- Adaptive maintenance- It is modyfying the software system  to adapt to changes in the environment.Changes in hardware or software e.t.c.
-Preventive maintenance- It includes taking measures to prevent problems in the future. Problems such as optimization updating documentation,reviewing and testing the system e.t.c.
- Software maintenance is an important part of the SDLC because it update the software application and do all modifications in software application so as to improve performance. 

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
- Data Privacy- User data must be collected, processed and stored properly and securely. Data frameworks such as GDPR and
